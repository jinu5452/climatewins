# ClimateWins

### Objective
Climate Wins, a European nonprofit organization, aims to help predict the climate change by using machine learning. 

### Hypothesis
1. The warming of the last 20 years is worse than before (1980-2000 vs 2000-2022)
2. Climate elements such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed are strongly correlated. 
3. Based on historical climate data, machine learning can predict future climate change.
